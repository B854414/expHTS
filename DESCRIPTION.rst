Python application for "Experimental High Throughput Sequencing"

High Throughput Sequencing is often conducted within an "Experimental" framework, meaning multiple samples are sequenced within a single experiment and should be processed in an identicle manner. expHTS facilities this by processing multiple samples within a single frame work and generating output so that sample quality can be easily compared across experiment samples.
